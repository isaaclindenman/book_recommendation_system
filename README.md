# book_recommendation_system

Using data from the top 10,000 books from Goodreads and associated data - plus my own Goodreads reading history - I sought out to use collaborative filtering to find the most relevant and highly rated books by similar users. Layered on top are other considerations such as new author, excluding series, and other options.
